Worldwide Coronavirus Stats using voice commands

Using just your voice on a microphone (external or internal), find out daily stats on the coronavirus such as new cases, deaths, recovered etc.

By simply asking to 'Update', the program will update the latest figures.

By using a free web-scraping tool called parsehub and the coronavirus stats website: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
with assistance from TechwithTim youtube channel, I was able to create this.
